# Virtual-Event-Platform

Our model works separately on following modules :
1.	Home Page: This is our website's landing page. The page that a user enters to view our services is called the home page.
2.	Login/Logout Page: On our website, users will have the option to register, log in with their ID to access services, and then log out.
3.	Event Page: Users are able to create and designate a specific date for their event. Our website will display their event.
 
4.	Meetings Page: The user will be able to conduct basic meetings. It is possible to take meetings and share the meeting link.
5.	Exhibition Page: It is a virtual display of the upcoming or current events in our website.
6.	Email Page: Sends email to the user to notify them for the latest events and upcoming events.
7.	FaQ Page: It gives quick answers to users questions. The idea is to keep the answers short and direct so that people find info quickly.
